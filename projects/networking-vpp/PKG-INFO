        ==============
        
        ML2 Mechanism driver and small control plane for the [VPP
        forwarder](`What is VPP <https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP/What_is_VPP%3F>`_)
        
        This is a Neutron mechanism driver to bring the advantages of VPP to
        OpenStack deployments.
        
        It's been written to be as simple and readable as possible while
        offering either full Neutron functionality or a simple roadmap to it.
        While the driver is not perfect, we're aiming for
        
        - robustness in the face of failures (of one of several Neutron
          servers, of agents, of the etcd nodes in the cluster gluing them
          together)
        - simplicity
        - testability - having failure cases covered is no good if you don't
          have a means to test the code that protects you from them
        
        As a general rule, everything is implemented in the simplest way, for
        three reasons: we get to see it working faster, we can test it, and
        anyone that wants to join the project can make sense of it.
